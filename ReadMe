3+1D Ideal Hydro 
*****************

1) Initial condition from optical Glauber and Monte Carlo Glauber model.
2) HLLE algo to solve hydro equation.
3) Freezeout hypersurface will be generated in "hydro_output/" folder in .xml format.
   One can use that .xml file as input for therminator code.
4) Particlisation through therminator. 



about the bash script "execution.sh" :
*************************************

1) After setting the parameters in the file "input.dat", one should run this script.
2) The script is wriiten in such a way that, after the completation of hydro evolution automatically
   the generatd file "hydro_output/*.xml" will move inside the therminator code. 
3) Then job will be submitted for hadronisationa. Finally after the completation of therminator
   run, one can collect the output .root files from "therminator/events/lhyquid3d*/ ".
